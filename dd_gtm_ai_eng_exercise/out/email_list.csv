I saw you're attending Digital Construction Week as Co-Owner at The Modern Builder. As someone overseeing construction investments, you understand the importance of having clear visibility into project progress and potential issues.

DroneDeploy provides automated aerial monitoring that gives property owners and developers like The Modern Builder unprecedented insight into their projects. Our platform helps you:

• Monitor multiple project sites remotely with regular automated flights
• Get objective progress reports independent of contractor updates
• Identify potential delays or issues before they impact timelines
• Document project milestones with high-resolution imagery and data
• Share progress with investors, lenders, and stakeholders easily

Many developers tell us our platform has transformed how they manage their construction investments and communicate with their teams.

We're demonstrating the platform at Booth #42 and offering free project evaluations to conference attendees. It would be great to show you how this could provide better oversight for The Modern Builder's projects.

Hope to see you there!

Jon Ozanne,CIO,Balfour Beatty,Owner,See your projects progress from anywhere - Free demo available,"Hi Jon Ozanne,

I saw you're attending Digital Construction Week as CIO at Balfour Beatty. As someone overseeing construction investments, you understand the importance of having clear visibility into project progress and potential issues.

DroneDeploy provides automated aerial monitoring that gives property owners and developers like Balfour Beatty unprecedented insight into their projects. Our platform helps you:

• Monitor multiple project sites remotely with regular automated flights
• Get objective progress reports independent of contractor updates
• Identify potential delays or issues before they impact timelines
• Document project milestones with high-resolution imagery and data
• Share progress with investors, lenders, and stakeholders easily

Many developers tell us our platform has transformed how they manage their construction investments and communicate with their teams.

We're demonstrating the platform at Booth #42 and offering free project evaluations to conference attendees. It would be great to show you how this could provide better oversight for Balfour Beatty's projects.

Hope to see you there!
