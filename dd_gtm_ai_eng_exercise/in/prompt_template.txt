- Continue to Step 2 if not Competitor/Partner

Step 2 - Role Classification (if not Competitor/Partner):
- BUILDER: Construction Manager, Project Manager, Engineer, Architect, Contractor, General Contractor, Specialty Contractor, Superintendent, Site Manager, BIM Manager, Construction Professional, Field Manager, Safety Manager
- OWNER: Real Estate Developer, Property Developer, Facility Manager, Asset Manager, Owner's Representative, Development Manager, Property Owner, Infrastructure Owner
- OTHER: Academic, government, consultant, unclear roles, or roles that don't fit Builder/Owner categories

Speaker: {speaker_name}
Title: {speaker_title}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Category: [Builder|Owner|Partner|Competitor|Other]
Reasoning: [Brief explanation of the classification decision]

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Only Builder and Owner categories will receive marketing emails
- Be conservative with Partner/Competitor classifications - when in doubt, classify as Builder/Owner if the role fits
- Focus primarily on the speaker's job title for Builder vs Owner distinction
- Consider the company context but prioritize the individual's role
